## MurmurHash

"MurmurHash is a non-cryptographic hash function suitable for general hash-based lookup. It was created by Austin Appleby in 2008, and exists in a number of variants,[6] all of which have been released into the public domain. The name comes from two basic operations, multiply (MU) and rotate (R), though the algorithm actually uses shift and xor instead of rotate.

Unlike cryptographic hash functions, it is not specifically designed to be difficult to reverse by an adversary, making it unsuitable for cryptographic purposes."
